           <p>Hello, My name is Oscar Umana Garcia and I am currently a Junior in high school studying Computer Science. I go to a school named Tappan Zee High School which is located in Orangeburg, NY.</p>
           <p>I was born in Nyack, NY but both of my parents were born in El Salvador. El Salvador is a country in Central America, with a population of 6 million people. Half of my family lives in El Salvador, so I still visit from time to time. It is a very fun experience, but also a terrible experience when leaving. </p>
           <p>I first discovered about coding from my friend in 8th grade. We were choosing our electives, and I wanted to be in the same classes as him. He choose computer science, so I did as well. I told him, ¨What is this class about.¨ He told me that it is a coding class where I can create many things. I took Computer Science 1 and 2 my freshman year, it was hard but overall I liked it. I took AP Computer Science my sophomore year, even though I had a rough start, I really enjoyed the class, and realized that I still want to do coding for the rest of my high school year.</p>
            <p>During my free time, I like to watch tv shows or play video games with some friends. I like to play FIFA, or also known as a soccer video game. Some of the tv shows I like to watch would be the DC shows on netflix. Some would be the Flash, Arrow, or I also like to watch Suits. Most of the time I am at the gym. I go to Retro Fitness in Tappan. I go because it allows me to stay fit and makes me busy when I have nothing to do in the afternoon. </p>
